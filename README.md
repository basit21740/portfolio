# @icheft's NTU Homepage
(might as well be the simple onepage site I am going to use in the future ‚ù§)

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/4e6d221b-aed0-41ca-adb9-aab8ab2147b0/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/icheftatntu/deploys)

This is a really simple site built for my NTU homepage at <http://homepage.ntu.edu.tw/~b07705031/>.



Feel free to fork the website and create your own one. If you have any questions or suggestions, please let me know by submitting an [issue](https://github.com/icheft/ntu-homepage/issues) or create a pull request.


## How to Use?
Fork this repo and change the name to `YOURUSERNAME.github.io`. You will see your site run perfectly on `https://YOURUSERNAME.github.io` directly after that.

You can also use it for building sub-pages for your main site like [this](http://icheft.github.io/ntu-homepage/). Just simply go to setting, and check the `Source` box.

Alternatively, you can deploy it using Netlify as shown [here](https://app.netlify.com/sites/icheftatntu/deploys); the demo can be viewed [here](https://icheftatntu.netlify.app). For those who are not familiar with Netlify, please as well read their [documentations](https://www.netlify.com).

For local build, click on `index.html` and you'll be able to see site locally.
